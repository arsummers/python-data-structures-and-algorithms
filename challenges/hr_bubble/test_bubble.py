Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement, where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement, where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.


Hint: To complete this challenge, you must add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution
