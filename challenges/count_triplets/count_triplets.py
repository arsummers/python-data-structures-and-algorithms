"""
You are given an array and you need to find number of tripets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at those indices are in geometric progression for a given common ratio r and i < j < k

a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio

example:

arr = [1, 4, 16, 64]
r = 4

triplets = [1, 4, 16] and [4, 16, 24]

return the number of triplets

    return triplets_count
