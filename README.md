# Reverse an Array
We were given instructions to write a function that will reverse a list or array.

Tammy Do, my partner for this challenge, helped me figure out the syntax of writing the function after I started testing my solution.

## Challenge
The challenge was to reverse an array. We had example input and output.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took what I saw at the shortest approach, and sliced the array one step at a time from back to front, so that it will reverse when printed. I may be wrong, but I believe this operates at O(1).

# Insert and Shift an Array
The instructions were to write a function that accepts an array/list and a value, and insert that value into the midpoint of the array.

Richard von Hagel was my partner for this challenge. He provided a few suggestions while I whiteboarded, and was helpful in talking through my solution.

## Challenge
I had to insert a value (in this case I used the number 7 across the board), into an array at the halfway point, and return the modified array. I wrote tests to see if the function worked.

## Approach & Efficiency
I utilized if/elif statements and integer division to verify my desired input. I then used Python's split function to modify and reconnect my arrays.
