        [first challenge](https://github.com/arsummers/python-data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/1)


# Reverse an Array
We were given instructions to write a function that will reverse a list or array.

Tammy Do, my partner for this challenge, helped me figure out the syntax of writing the function after I started testing my solution.

## Challenge
The challenge was to reverse an array. We had example input and output.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took what I saw at the shortest approach, and sliced the array one step at a time from back to front, so that it will reverse when printed. I may be wrong, but I believe this operates at O(1).
